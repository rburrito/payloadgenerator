# PGen
PGen is a tool written in Bash to generate the most common Meterpreter payloads via MSFvenom, part of the Metasploit framework.

# About
PGen is a wrapper around MSFvenom that provides a more user friendly experience to generate multiple types of payloads. Our intent is to make the experience as uncomplicated as possible to produce a payload. Instead of users going through MSFvenom manually looking for a specific payload, our goal is to simplify the process for those that are beginners in Ethical Hacking or PWK and to customize the payload generating experience. PGen prompts users for information defining their target and calls msfvenom in the background to generate a payload.
